### 🐱 Hi there, I'm Hykilpikonna!

I'm Hykilpikonna, a first-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, majoring in computer science and psychology. I'm interested in web development and machine learning. I'm currently doing research on voice-based gender identification for Chinese speakers.

I also love cats =^･-･^=
